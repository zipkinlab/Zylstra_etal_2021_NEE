## R code for 2004-2018 models 
1. [FullModel_2004-2018.R](FullAnnualCycleModel_2004-2018/FullModel_2004-2018.R): R code used to model population dynamics of monarch butterflies (*Danaus plexippus*) in eastern North America between 2004 and 2018. This is the model used for inferences that includes all seasonal covariates.
2. [HierarchicalPartitioning_Summer_2004-2018.R](FullAnnualCycleModel_2004-2018/HierarchicalPartitioning_Summer_2004-2018.R): R code used to run all models needed to evaluate the relative importance of covariates in the summer submodel. Includes code to run hierarchical partitioning analysis.
3. [HierarchicalPartitioning_EarlyWinter_2004-2018.R](FullAnnualCycleModel_2004-2018/HierarchicalPartitioning_EarlyWinter_2004-2018.R): R code used to run all models needed to evaluate the relative importance of covariates in the winter submodel. Includes code to run hierarchical partitioning analysis.
4. [ReducedModel_2004-2018.R](ReducedAnnualCycleModel_2004-2018/ReducedModel_2004-2018.R): R code used to model population dynamics of monarch butterflies in eastern North America between 2004 and 2018. This is a reduced model, similar to that used for 1994-2003 data. Results were used to verify that estimates from a reduced model were consistent with those from a full annual-cycle model using data from the same period.
