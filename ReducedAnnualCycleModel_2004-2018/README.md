# ReducedAnnualCycleModel_2004-2018


## R code for 2004-2018 models 
4. [ReducedModel_2004-2018.R](ReducedAnnualCycleModel_2004-2018/ReducedModel_2004-2018.R): R code used to model population dynamics of monarch butterflies in eastern North America between 2004 and 2018. This is a reduced model, similar to that used for 1994-2003 data. Results were used to verify that estimates from a reduced model were consistent with those from a full annual-cycle model using data from the same period.
